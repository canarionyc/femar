# Notes to Consider When Using the Microdata File and Replicate Weights
# 1. Publication standards: We do not publish RECS estimates where the RSE is higher than 50 or the number of households used for the calculation is less than 10 (indicated by a Q in the data tables). We recommend following these guidelines for custom analysis using the public use microdata file.
# 2. Imputation variables: We imputed most variables for Donâ€™t Know and Refuse responses. The Z variables, also referred to as imputation flags, are in the public use microdata file. The imputation flag indicates whether we based the corresponding non-Z variable was reported data (Z variable = 0) or if we imputed it (Z variable = 1). Variables from the RECS questionnaire that we did not impute, contained no missing data, or were not from the questionnaire have no corresponding Z variables. We recommend using the imputed data, where available, to avoid biased estimation.
# 3. Standardized coding: Variables that we did not ask all respondents use the response code â€“2 for Not Applicable. For example, respondents who answered that they did not use any televisions at home (TVCOLOR = 0) were not asked what size television they most use at home, so TVSIZE1 = -2. Use caution when performing calculations on variables that have -2 responses.
# 4. Indicator variables: The microdata file contains variables to indicate the use of major fuels and specific end uses within each housing unit for 2020. We derived these variables from answers given by each respondent, and they indicate whether the respondent had access to the fuel, used the fuel, and engaged in a specific end use. All indicators are either a 0 or a 1 for each combination of major fuel and end use. For example, respondents who say they heated their homes with electricity in 2020 will have the derived variable ELWARM = 1. If respondents say they have equipment but did not use it, the corresponding indicator is 0. As an example, respondents in a warm climate might have heating equipment but did not use it in 2020. For this case, ELWARM is 0.
# 5. Confidentiality: We collected the 2020 RECS under the authority of the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA). The agency, project staff, and our contractors and agents are personally accountable for protecting the identity of individual respondents. We took the following steps to avoid disclosing personally identifiable information in the public-use microdata file.
# June 2023
# U.S. Energy Information Administration | Using the Microdata File to Compute Estimates and Standard Errors 14
# â€¢ We removed local geographic identifiers of sampled housing units, such as addresses.
# â€¢ We removed the following variables because we received too few responses or because we found a disclosure risk:
#   â€“ COMBINED (on-site combined heat and power)
# â€“ WIND (on-site wind generation)
# â€“ PVINSTALL (year photovoltaic solar [PV] was installed)
# â€“ PVCAPACITY (capacity of PV system in kilowatts)
# â€“ APTEVCHG (do respondents in apartment building with 5+ units have access to an electric vehicle [EV] charger)
# â€“ EVMAKE, EVMODEL, EVYEAR (EV make, model, and year)
# â€“ EVCHRGAPT, EVCHRGWKS, EVCHRGBUS, EVCHRGMUNI, EVCHRGHWY, EVHCRGOTH (respondent charged an EV at their apartment building, place of work, a business or shopping center, a municipal parking lot, a highway rest stop, a car dealership, or somewhere else)
# â€“ EVHOMEAMT (what percentage of EV charging was done at home)
# â€“ EVCHRGTYPE (what type of EV charger does respondent have at home)
# â€“ EVWRKMILES (average number of miles EV is driven a week)
# â€¢ The following variables were top-coded:
#   â€“ BEDROOMS (number of bedrooms) to 6
# â€“ OTHROOMS (number of other rooms) to 9
# â€“ NCOMBATH (number of full bathrooms) to 4
# â€“ NHAFBATH (number of half bathrooms) to 2
# â€“ HHAGE (age of the householder) to 90
# â€“ NHSLDMEM (number of household members) to 7
# â€“ NUMCHILD (number of children under 18) to 4
# â€¢ We added random errors to weather and climate (HDD30YR and CDD30YR) values, as well as to the annualized consumption variables for electricity and natural gas.
# June 2023
# Adjustments were minor and do not result in significant differences for aggregate estimation.
# â€¢ We rounded the SQFTEST, TOTSQFT_EN, TOTHSQFT, and TOTCSQFT variables to the nearest 10.
